# GBAengine
I was making a game and my approach was based off of the GBA. Ended up making a borderline GBA emulator, so I went all out. Now I want to make an engine or something.
This program is actually outdated. I am going going to make a different engine (AGBE), which is what I was trying to pull off here, but in C++ instead of PY.
Once I finish the high level version of the low level stuff I've already made, I shall actually add it to GitHub. And if this isn't the LICENSE, I don't know how to add one.
